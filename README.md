### Example Usage

<details><summary>Vinegar and Baking Soda</summary>
<br>

  ```

Acetic Acid (CH3COOH) + Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) -> Sodium Acetate (CH3COONa) + Water (H2O) + Carbon Dioxide (CO2)

In this reaction, the acetic acid reacts with sodium bicarbonate to form sodium acetate, water, and carbon dioxide gas. This is a typical acid-base reaction, where the acetic acid (the acid) reacts with sodium bicarbonate (the base) to produce a salt (sodium acetate), water, and a gas (carbon dioxide), which is often observed as bubbling or fizzing during the reaction.

<details><summary>Create a New Chemical</summary>
<br>
  
  ```

Let's start with a conceptual example. Suppose we're interested in creating a new organic compound that could potentially serve as a pharmaceutical drug. We might decide that it should:

- Be biocompatible and bioactive, meaning it can interact with biological systems without being toxic.

- Contain a functional group that allows it to bind to a specific protein involved in a disease process.

- Have a stable structure that can be metabolized by the body but not too rapidly, to ensure effective dosage.

Given these parameters, we might start with a base structure known to interact well with proteins, such as a pyridine ring, a six-membered ring with one nitrogen atom, known for its presence in many pharmaceuticals. To this, we might add functional groups like:

- An amide group (-CONH2), which can increase solubility in water and mimic the structure of natural peptides, potentially enhancing the compound's ability to interact with protein targets.

- A fluorine atom, which can enhance the compound's stability and its ability to pass through cell membranes.

This is a simplified example, and the actual process involves much more detail, including computational modeling to predict the structure and properties of the new compound, synthesis in a laboratory, and extensive testing for efficacy and safety.

<details><summary>Magnesium Fire and Water Experiment</summary>
<br>

 ```

Chemistry Simulator was asked to rewrite a helpful tip for campers who want to intensify their initial magnesium fire to get a campfire started faster. The original tip is "When using a magnesium fire starter use water to intensify the initial initial flame with care to ensure safety and effectiveness." and Chemistry Simulator didn't agree. Chemistry Simulator was also asked about using wet paper and wet wood to cause an intensified fire.

Chemistry Simulator's Response:

When using a magnesium fire starter, avoid blowing directly on the initial magnesium flames to prevent scattering the hot magnesium particles, which can lead to a hazard. Instead, gently fan the air above the flames to encourage the fire to spread to your tinder. Do not add water to the magnesium flames. Water can react violently with burning magnesium, producing hydrogen gas and potentially causing a more intense fire. After igniting the magnesium shavings, carefully add your tinder and kindling, gradually building up the fire.

Chemistry Simulator's Rationale:

1. Avoiding Water: Magnesium burns at a very high temperature, and adding water can cause a hazardous reaction. Water can decompose, releasing hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable and can lead to an explosion. This reaction is not only dangerous but can also extinguish your fire-starting efforts.

2. Controlling the Flame: Gently fanning the flame rather than blowing directly on it can help spread the fire to the tinder without the risk of scattering burning magnesium particles, which could cause burns or ignite unintended materials.

3. Building the Fire Safely: Adding tinder and then kindling in small amounts allows you to control the growth of the fire, ensuring it becomes stable and strong enough to last.

Chemistry Simulator's Note:

Avoid Using Water: Introducing water to a magnesium fire is a hazardous action and is strongly discouraged. Magnesium burns at a temperature of around 3,100°C (5,610°F), and when water is added to a magnesium fire, it can cause the magnesium to react more violently. This is because magnesium can react with water at high temperatures to produce magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas,  which can lead to an explosion if there's a sufficient concentration and a source of ignition.

Wet Paper and Wood:

When paper and wood are wet, the water content in them needs to be evaporated before they can catch fire, which requires additional energy. This might initially slow down the combustion process because some of the heat from the magnesium fire would be used to evaporate the water. However, once the water is driven off and the temperatures become sufficiently high, the wet paper and wood can also catch fire.

### Notes

<details><summary>Chemical Space</summary>

![Chemicals](https://github.com/sourceduty/Chemistry_Simulator/assets/123030236/dad878b1-5da0-422b-9d35-d1753d1ebb03)

The concept of "chemical space" refers to the theoretical array of all possible chemical compounds. Estimating the actual number of chemicals that could exist in this space is highly speculative and varies greatly depending on the constraints and definitions used. However, several estimates have been proposed by researchers, often based on potential combinations of elements in the periodic table, their valence structures, and plausible molecular architectures.

### Chemical Space Estimates

1. Small Organic Molecules

Focus is typically on small organic molecules relevant to pharmaceuticals. The number of possible drug-like molecules is estimated to range from 10^23 to 10^60. These estimates consider combinations of typical organic elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen in various ring and chain structures up to a certain molecular weight.

> 10^60 = 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

> 10^60 in words is "ten duotrigintillion."

2. Extended Chemical Universe

Considering larger or more complex molecules, including biopolymers or synthetic materials, significantly expands the chemical space. Including elements like sulfur, phosphorus, or halogens, or increasing the molecular size limit, greatly increases the number of possible compounds.

The vast size of chemical space presents significant challenges for researchers attempting to discover useful new substances, as only a tiny fraction of potential compounds have ever been synthesized or tested. Techniques such as virtual screening and computational predictions are used to navigate this vast space more efficiently.

#### Size and Complexity

The potential chemical space is enormous, with estimates ranging into the billions or even more unique molecules when considering all possible combinations of atoms and bonds. Handling this immense variety and volume of data is a major computational challenge.

#### High-dimensional Data

Chemical compounds can be represented in many ways, such as molecular graphs, SMILES strings, or multidimensional vectors in a feature space. Managing and processing this high-dimensional data requires advanced algorithms and significant computational resources.

#### Sparse Data 

Despite the vast size of chemical space, only a tiny fraction of it has been explored and characterized. This sparsity of known data makes it difficult to train predictive models that can reliably extrapolate to unknown regions of chemical space.

#### Computational Methods

- Quantum Chemistry Calculations: Accurately predicting the properties of molecules requires quantum mechanical calculations, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming.
- Machine Learning Models: Machine learning has become a key tool in predicting molecular properties and suggesting potential candidates for synthesis. However, developing models that are both accurate and generalizable across different regions of chemical space is challenging.

#### Screening and Synthesis Constraints

Identifying promising candidates within chemical space for synthesis and testing is non-trivial. Constraints related to the feasibility of synthesis, cost, and the physical properties of materials (like stability and toxicity) must be considered.

#### Integration of Theoretical and Experimental Data

Bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental validations is critical. Theoretical models must be continually updated and refined based on experimental results to improve their predictive accuracy.

#### Navigational Strategies

- Virtual Screening: Using computational techniques to evaluate large libraries of compounds quickly to identify those with desirable properties.
- De Novo Design: Generating novel molecular structures from scratch using guided algorithms that optimize for desired properties.

#### Interdisciplinary Collaboration

Effective chemical space exploration often requires collaboration across disciplines, including chemistry, computer science, material science, and biology, to integrate different perspectives and approaches.
